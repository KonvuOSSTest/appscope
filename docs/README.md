# AppScope - Design Docs

Before delving into the docs here, you should be familiar already with:

- The main [README](../README.md) at the top level of this project
- The user docs on the [AppScope website](https://appscope.dev/docs/)

The docs in this directory cover aspects of the AppScope design and our development process. They are intended for use by developers contributing to the project instead of SREs, sysadmins, etc. who are using AppScope as a tool.

- The AppScope [release process](./RELEASE.md) - Branches, tags, workflows, and so on.

> We will be adding more over time.
