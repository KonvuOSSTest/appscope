## Installing
---

First, see [Requirements](/docs/requirements) to ensure that you’re completing these steps on a supported system. Getting started is easy.

### Get AppScope

Directly download the CLI binary from [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/cli/linux/scope](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/io.cribl.cdn/dl/scope/cli/linux/scope). Use this command to both download and make it executable:


```
curl -Lo scope https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/cli/linux/scope && chmod 755 ./scope
```

That's it!


### Explore the CLI

Run `scope --help` or `scope -h` to view CLI options. Also see the complete [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference).



### Next Steps

Get into the CLI with the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/quick-start-guide).
