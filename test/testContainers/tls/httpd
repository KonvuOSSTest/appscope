# 'prefork' model.  A thread-based model, 'worker', is also
# available, but does not work with some modules (such as PHP).
# The service must be stopped before changing this variable.

# By default, the httpd process will create the file
# /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid in which it records its process
# identification number when it starts.  If an alternate location is
# specified in httpd.conf (via the PidFile directive), the new
# location needs to be reported in the PIDFILE.
